# Geneta
Redefining the standard unix command for text manipulation and processing.
Existing commands for text processing like grep, awk and sed are highly complex and having high learning curve for new learners. So, here we are creating a brand new cli for *nix based systems - geneta.

## Salient features
1. The command will be a swiss army knife for text processing.
1. Almost all the tasks that the existing commands do can be done with this command.
1. JSON like syntax will be used for performing operations and queries.

## Uses
Command is under development and will soon be ready for public use.
